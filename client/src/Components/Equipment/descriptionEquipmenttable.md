# Equipment Table Component

The EquipmentTable component is responsible for rendering a table that displays a list of equipment. It allows the user to search, filter, sort, and edit the equipment items.

Initialization
The component starts by initializing the three filter states: nameFilter, typeFilter, and amountFilter. These states will be used to filter the equipment list based on the user's search input. Each of them is initialized with an empty string.

jsx
Copy code
const [nameFilter, setNameFilter] = useState("");
const [typeFilter, setTypeFilter] = useState("");
const [amountFilter, setAmountFilter] = useState("");
The component also initializes the sorting state with an empty object, which means that the table will not be sorted by default.

jsx
Copy code
const [sorting, setSorting] = useState({});
Sorting
The handleSort function is responsible for updating the sorting state based on the user's selection. It takes two parameters: property and direction.

jsx
Copy code
const handleSort = (property, direction) => {
  setSorting({ property, direction });
};
The sortedEquipments variable is derived from the equipments prop and the sorting state. If the sorting state is empty, the list will be displayed in its original order. Otherwise, the list will be sorted based on the selected property and direction.

jsx
Copy code
const sortedEquipments = equipments.sort((a, b) => {
  if (!sorting.property) {
    return 0;
  }

  const sortOrder = sorting.direction === "asc" ? 1 : -1;

  if (a[sorting.property] < b[sorting.property]) {
    return -1 * sortOrder;
  }

  if (a[sorting.property] > b[sorting.property]) {
    return 1 * sortOrder;
  }

  return 0;
});
Rendering
The component renders the table headers, with the sorting arrows indicating the current sorting option. The onSort function is called when the user clicks on a table header, which will update the sorting state accordingly.

jsx
Copy code
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th onClick={() => onSort("name")}>
      Name {sorting.property === "name" && (sorting.direction === "asc" ? "↑" : "↓")}
    </th>
    <th onClick={() => onSort("type")}>
      Type {sorting.property === "type" && (sorting.direction === "asc" ? "↑" : "↓")}
    </th>
    <th onClick={() => onSort("amount")}>
      Amount {sorting.property === "amount" && (sorting.direction === "asc" ? "↑" : "↓")}
    </th>
    <th>Actions</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
Finally, the component maps over the sortedEquipments array and renders an Equipment component for each item in the list. We pass the necessary props to the Equipment component, including the onUpdate and onDelete functions, which will be used to update or delete an equipment item from the list.

jsx
Copy code
<tbody>
  {sortedEquipments.map((equipment) => (
    <Equipment
      key={equipment.id}
      equipment={equipment}
      onUpdate={onUpdate}
      onDelete={onDelete}
    />
  ))}
</tbody>
Editing
The Equipment component is responsible for rendering each equipment item and allowing the user to edit it. When the user clicks the "Edit" button, the isEditing state is set to true, which displays the input fields. When the user clicks the "Save" button, the isEditing state is set to false and the updated equipment object is passed to the onUpdate function, which will update the corresponding item in the list.

The name, type, and amount states are used to store the current values of the equipment object being edited. When the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the isEditing state is set to false and the previous values are restored.

The Equipment component receives the equipment object as a prop and renders its name, type, and amount properties. If the user is editing the equipment item, the corresponding input fields are displayed instead.

The input fields have onChange handlers that update the corresponding state values whenever the user types in them.

The "Delete" button calls the onDelete function with the equipment's id as an argument, which will remove the corresponding item from the list.

Overall, the Equipment component provides a user-friendly way to edit and delete equipment items from the list. The EquipmentTable component provides sorting and filtering capabilities, making it easy for the user to find and manage the desired equipment.
