### **Task #1 (Previous Company) Previous Company Requirements**

1. **Extend the storage/data model** with a **Company object** (the minimum information that needs to be stored about a company is its name as a string), e.g. each Employee can have only one company associated with it (where the employee worked at previously).

2. **Creating a new company** should be possible from the frontend (only creating such objects is enough, no need for a List of companies) - you can pre-create a few companies as an example via mongosh or MongoDB Compass.

3. Have a link **Create Company** on the navbar to access this page/feature.
[X]

4. When **editing an employee** allow users to **select from the existing list of companies** where the employee previously worked at.

5. Make sure this extra information can be **saved/persisted** - no need to be able to "delete" (disassociate) employees and companies.
